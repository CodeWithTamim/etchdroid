EtchDroid is a copylefted libre GPLv3+ app helping you write images to USB drives.
Use it to make a bootable GNU/Linux USB drive when your laptop is dead and you're in the middle of nowhere.

Features:
• Supports raw disk images and most GNU/Linux distributions ISOs
• Supports Raspberry Pi images (extract the ZIP file first; use a SD to USB adapter, the internal SD slot is not supported)
• Supports most DMG disk images (beta)
• No root - everything is done within the bounds of the Android API
• Free as in freedom

Planned:
• Write common GNU/Linux distro in streaming from the Internet without storing it on the device
• Support for Windows installation ISO (will likely require root)
• Support for Unetbootin-style image flashing
